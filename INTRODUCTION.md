# Project Motivation

The motive of this project is to have you a taste of the environment and tools
you will most likely come across in a front end role. Your focus should be to
understand the role every tool and technology is playing in the overall
architecture. You shouldn’t feel the need to memorize the particular commands,
config setups, or structure that we create here. Every project in the industry
will have its own custom setup, but if you understand the moving pieces, you
will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this
one.

# Project Introduction - What You Will Build

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing
(NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an
application to understand the human language, written or oral.

You don't have to worry about NLP, because we will make use of an external api
called Aylien to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help us
classify the information available in the article, like whether the content is
subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive,
neutral, or negative in tone.

Following are the project prerequisites:

Webserver - Node
Web application framework for routing - Express
Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
External script - Service Worker
External API - Aylien

# Introduction to Natural Language Processing

NLP is a subset of AI that provides computers ability to process or interact
with natural human speech. In NLP, machine learning and deep learning are used
on massive amounts of data to obtain the rules and understanding of nuance in
human speech.

## NLP on Human Voice

For example, everyone who has used Alexa or Google Assistant or other voice
command systems knows that these devices are always improving, by collecting
and interpreting voice data. Verbal interactions can be incredibly hard to
decipher. Sarcasm, for instance, requires understanding not just words and
grammar but the tone as well, and regional accents and ways of saying things
have to be taken into account, not to mention coverage for all the major
languages.

## NLP on Text

An example is Grammarly editing tool, which parses the text that you write, and
suggests if the tone is professional or not. Another example is the Smart
Compose feature for Gmail that uses NLP to suggest words and statements based
on your current context.

It requires a vast amount of knowledge from machine learning, deep learning,
AI, statistics, and programming to create NLP systems and algorithms. But,
thankfully we will use a new API called Aylien, that has put a public-facing
API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in our project to determine
various attributes of an article or blog post.
